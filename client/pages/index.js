            We'll I'm an introvert, I always try smiling, even though I am sad. I always challange myself through coding
            and life in general. I spend most of my time coding or practicing maths. I'm person who likes to chill with his
            family and friends. 
          </p>
          <p>

        <h3>Why do you want to be a developer at SovTech?</h3>
          <p>
            Besides the fact that 'SovTech' is a software development company. When I did my research about 
            the company, different sources, and employees all say positive things about the company. Weather young or old 
            people treat each other with respect. There's room for improvement and/or growth. That is one of the things I like
            about <span>SovTech</span>. The research i conducted states that there is a great company culture.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My former employer had an open office plan, from the pictures I saw online i can tell that SovTech has an open office 
            plan. Having everyone working within an open space can be great for turning an office into a productive hub of 
            communication and collaboration. It would be a great learning enviroment surrounding myself with everyone in the office.
