Whether young or old people treat each other with respect. There is always room for improvement and/or growth. That is one of the things I like about SovTech. The research i conducted states that there is a great company culture.'

Having everyone working within an open space can be great for turning an office into a productive hub of communication and collaboration. It would be a great learning enviroment surrounding myself with everyone in the office.'

Programming has always been fun for me, the challenge of solving problems tells a story and convey an idea. There's so many things i can learn from SovTech mentors and/or employees."

Well I am a person who believes working alone is productive but working in a team brings in very good results, and I understand that in order to achieve difficult work or projects or tasks, I should work with other people, I must consider thier skills and experiences. I am also good at working under pressure, I actually prefer to be working under pressure. I tend to be at my best under pressure. I am also good in building up relationships with different people even though at first I am shy and I talk less, so I am always focused on achieving difficult tasks and projects that are aligned to work environments."
